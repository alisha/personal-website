        <h3>Conjuguemos - Game Developer (Summer 2015)</h3>
        <p>I'm currently developing a game to help students learn verb conjugations in other languages.</p>

        <h3>StudentRND - CodeDay Boston Organizer and Evangelist (Spring 2015-Present)</h3>
        <p>CodeDay is a 24-hour programming event that helps high school students fall in love in with programming! After being a participant for three seasons, I decided to help organize the event.</p>
        <p>As a CodeDay Local Organizer, I find sponsors, mentors, and judges, and advertise to students. As an Evangelist, I ran a workshop to introduce students to programming, checked in with teams, and helped those who were stuck.</p>

        <h3>Garner Lab, Harvard University - Research Intern (Summer 2014-Present)</h3>
        <p>Conservation of Bacterial Volume: I investigated whether bacteria are able to conserve their volume by adding gas vesicle genes from <i>Bacillus megaterium</i> to <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>. By analyzing micrographs with ImageJ, I determined that bacteria tended to compensate for this added stress, and maintained a similar volume.</p>
        <p>Detecting degenerate motifs: I became fascinated by CRISPR/CAS systems that bacteria use for defense against viruses. However, nobody had ever figured out if the CRISPR motifs were conserved through natural selection. I'm developing an algorithm that can process bacterial genomes and find degenerate motifs. This will allow us to better understand the evolutionary history of bacteria and viruses.</p>
