        <p>I currently attend Weston High School, where I have a 4.63 weighted GPA and 3.97 unweighted GPA.</p>

        <p>After taking AP Computer Science in freshman year, I decided to look to courses outside of school for more knowledge. I've taken the <a href="">"Dynamic Web Applications"</a> and <a href="http://cs50.harvard.edu">"CS50: Intensive Introduction to Computer Science"</a> classes at Harvard University.</p>

        <p>I also received college credit for the "Biotechnology" class at UPenn's Summer Academy for Applied Science and Technology (now Engineering Summer Academy at Penn).</p>
