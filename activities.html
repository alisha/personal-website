        <h3>Mentor (2014-Present)</h3>
        <p>Every week, I mentor our future programmers: middle school girls! I help them organize ideas and problem solve as they make games in Scratch.</p>

        <p>I'm a dedicated member of Code for Boston, a Code for America organization that aims to better the lives of citizens in Boston.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working on <a href="">Ungentry</a>, a map of urbanization and gentrification patterns in Boston. In addition to working on the UX, I'm also adding data on home mortgage requests.</p>
        <p>When I first joined, I made a <a href="">guide</a> to help local animal shelters make <a href="">Twitter bots that tweet about their adoptable pets</a>.</p>

        <p>As a secretary, I took attendance at weekly meetings, sent email summaries of meetings, sent sureys for team members' round preferences, helped organize round assignments, organized study workshops, planning our first USABO competition, and organized fun things like secret psyche and t-shirts.</p>
