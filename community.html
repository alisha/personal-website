          <h2>Code for Boston (2014&ndash;Present)</h2>
          <h3>Project Lead (2016&ndash;Present)</h3>
          <p>I'm a dedicated member of <a href="http://codeforboston.org/">Code for Boston</a>, a Code for America organization where volunteers collaborate on social and civic projects to improve the lives of Bostonians.</p>
          <p>Currently, I'm a Project Lead to get the civic tech community involved with my work at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. The overall project is to build software that helps automate the City of Boston's process to match teens with summer jobs (currently they hand-assign these matches, which takes thosuands of hours).</p>
          <p>In the past, I've worked on <a href="http://codeforboston.github.io/ungentry/">Ungentry</a>, a map of urbanization and gentrification patterns in Boston. I also made a <a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/CutePetsBoston/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Twitter-Bot">guide</a> to help local animal shelters make <a href="https://twitter.com/CutePetsBoston">Twitter bots</a> that tweet about their adoptable pets.</p>
          <p>Check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66U8V2X61NA">Ignite talk</a> at Code for Boston's National Day of Civic Hacking 2015 event!</p>

          <h2>Weston High School Computer Science Team (2012&ndash;2016)</h2>
          <h3>President (2015&ndash;2016)</h3>
          <p>Every week, students gather to code and work on projects in the Computer Science Team. As President, I'm working to transform our group into a more collaborative environment as we all work on a single coding project for the first time. We also participate in competitions. At the 2015 Providence College High School Programming Contest, I was one of four students to represent our school, and our team earned 3rd Place. We also encourage our members to participate in the monthly USA Computing Olympiad contests, of which I'm a Silver Division competitor.</p>
          <br>

          <h2>Weston High School Science Team (2012&ndash;2016)</h2>
          <h3>Co-Captain (2015&ndash;2016), Secretary (2014&ndash;2015)</h3>
          <p>Our Science Team participates in Science Olympiad, both in regional and state competitions. My favorite rounds are Cell Biology, Designer Genes, Chem Lab, Evolution, and Picture This.</p>
          <p>As Co-Captain, I assign team members to rounds for our monthly Science Olympiad competitions and help them get organized and prepare for their rounds. I also research outside competitions, and thanks to this, we've participated in our first Science Olympiad invitational and first USABO qualifying exam.</p>

          <h2>Weston High School Math Team (2012&ndash;2016)</h2>
          <h3>Co-Captain (2015&ndash;2016)</h3>
          <p>Our Math Team participates in competitions like the New England Math League contests, Purple Comet, Harvard MIT Math Tournament, and MA Math League meets. I'm a dedicated member, and I enjoy using my math skills in these events.</p>
          <p>As co-captain, I'm expanding our community by fostering an inclusive and diverse environment where everybody learns! In addition, I work with the other co-captains to assign people to rounds for our monthly competitions.</p>
          <br>

          <h2>Girls Who Code Weston (2014&ndash;2015)</h2>
          <h3>Mentor (2014&ndash;2015)</h3>
          <p>Every week, I mentored our future programmers: middle school girls! I helped them organize ideas and problem solve as they made games in Scratch.</p>
          <br>

          <h2>Weston High School Principal's Advisory Council (2013&ndash;2015)</h2>
          <h3>Class of 2016 Representative (2013&ndash;2015)</h3>
          <p>PAC is a committee of students and faculty who meet with our principal every month to discuss ways we can improve our school. In addition to attending monthly meetings, I was on the Library Renovations Committee, where I sent out surveys and led focus groups to help transform our library into a learning commons.</p>
          <br>

          <h2>Weston High School Student Council (2012&ndash;2015)</h2>
          <h3>Class of 2016 Representative (2012&ndash;2015)</h3>
          <p>During my time on Student Council, I helped to plan school-wide events that strengthened our community and helped others. For example, Student Council is in charge of the annual Spring Fling event, a fundraiser where high school clubs run booths for children. We've donated to <a href="http://www.nolimitsfoundation.org">Camp No Limits</a> and <a href="http://www.cityyear.org">City Year Boston</a> in the past.</p>
