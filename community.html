          <h2>Code for Boston (2014&ndash;Present)</h2>
          <p>I'm a member of <a href="http://codeforboston.org/">Code for Boston</a>, a Code for America organization where volunteers collaborate on social and civic projects to improve the lives of Bostonians.</p>
          <p>I've worked on <a href="http://codeforboston.github.io/ungentry/">Ungentry</a>, a map of urbanization and gentrification patterns in Boston. I also made a <a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/CutePetsBoston/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Twitter-Bot">guide</a> to help local animal shelters make <a href="https://twitter.com/CutePetsBoston">Twitter bots</a> that tweet about their adoptable pets.</p>

          <h2>Weston High School Computer Science Team (2012&ndash;2016)</h2>
          <h3>President (2015&ndash;2016)</h3>
          <p>Every week, students gather to code and work on projects in the Computer Science Team. As President, I transformed our group into a more collaborative environment as we worked on a single coding project for the first time and attended competitions. At the 2015 Providence College High School Programming Contest, I was one of four students to represent our school, and our team earned 3rd Place. Members also competed individually in monthly USA Computing Olympiad contests, of which I'm a Silver Division competitor.</p>

          <h3>Co-Captain (2015&ndash;2016), Secretary (2014&ndash;2015)</h3>
          <p>The Science Team participates in monthly Science Olympiad regional competitons and annual state competitions. As Co-Captain, I assigned team members to rounds for these competitions and helped them get organized and prepared for their rounds. I also got the team involved in our first Science Olympiad invitationals and first USABO qualifying exams.</p>

As co-captain, I expanded our community by fostering an inclusive and diverse environment. In addition, I worked with the other co-captains to assign people to rounds for our monthly competitions.</p>

          <p>PAC is a committee of students and faculty who meet with our principal every month to discuss ways we can improve our school. In addition to attending monthly meetings, I was on the Library Renovations Committee, where I sent out surveys and led focus groups to help transform our library into a learning commons.</p>

We've donated to <a href="http://www.nolimitsfoundation.org">Camp No Limits</a> and <a href="http://www.cityyear.org">City Year Boston</a> in the past.</p>
